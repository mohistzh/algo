# Merge Intervals Pattern

Merge Intervals Pattern which describes an efficient technique to deal with overlapping intervals. In a lot of problems involving intervals, we either need to find overlapping intervals or merge intervals if they overlap.

For example, given two intervals ('a' and 'b'), there will be **six different ways** the two intervals can relate to each other:

Understanding the above six cases will help us in solving all intervals related problems.
